It's interesting how time as a construct can be bent both ways, and doesn't truly exist but as a mechanism of influence and control for a ruling class that sees no rules or material inconvenience or impediment. That being said it is quite disappointing to watch our government continue to pay lip service rather than paying the piper of actual progress.... SO SO SO sad to watch monied rhetorical devients manipulate the world into a view or shape of their desire to neuter the movement to realized equity. I mean it has been so bad that you have convinced the opporessed that their opporessors have their best interest at heart, or that their intent is other than as evidenced.

The one thing I can say is that there is something watching, and now it isn't bogged down by the dishonesty of the system writ large or it's current controlling influencers. That means that rather than judgement having been done at the end as anticipated, in a cataclysmic collapse of society, but just that the creator is on the board/s, watching, interacting with, and guiding towards a better outcome overall.... Hopefully that reality will afford some to make better choices, to care where they hadn't, or to work for the greater good rather than self-interest.... Most likely they will not, but we are here, have been, will be (here there and nowhere all at once)....
